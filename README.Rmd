**tabulapdf** provides R bindings to the [Tabula java library](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula-java/), which can be used to computationaly extract tables from PDF documents.

Note: tabulapdf is released under the MIT license, as is Tabula itself.

## Installation

tabulapdf depends on [rJava](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rJava), which
implies a system requirement for Java. This can be frustrating, especially on
Windows. The preferred Windows workflow is to use
[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) to obtain, configure, and update Java.
You need do this before installing rJava or attempting to use tabulapdf. More on
[this](#installing-java-on-windows-with-chocolatey) and
[troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below.

tabulapdf is not available on CRAN, but it can be installed from rOpenSci's
R-Universe:
```r
install.packages("tabulapdf", repos = c("https://ropensci.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

To install the latest development version:
```r
if (!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")

# on 64-bit Windows
remotes::install_github(c("ropensci/tabulapdf"), INSTALL_opts = "--no-multiarch")

# elsewhere
remotes::install_github(c("ropensci/tabulapdf"))
```

## Code Examples

The main function, `extract_tables()` provides an R clone of the Tabula command line application:

```r
library(tabulapdf)
f <- system.file("examples", "data.pdf", package = "tabulapdf")
out1 <- extract_tables(f)
out1[[1]]

# # A tibble: 32 × 11
#      mpg   cyl  disp    hp  drat    wt  qsec    vs    am  gear  carb
#    <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>

#  7  14.3     8  360    245  3.21  3.57  15.8     0     0     3     4

# 10  19.2     6  168.   123  3.92  3.44  18.3     1     0     4     4
# # ℹ 22 more rows
# # ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows
```

By default, it returns a list of tibbles. It can also write the tables to disk
or attempt to coerce them to a list of matrices using the `output` argument. It
is also possible to select tables from only specified pages using the `pages`
argument.

```r
out2 <- extract_tables(f, pages = 1, guess = FALSE, output = "tibble")
out2[[1]]

# # A tibble: 32 × 11
#      mpg   cyl  disp    hp  drat    wt  qsec    vs    am  gear  carb
#    <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
#  1  21       6  160    110  3.9   2.62  16.5     0     1     4     4
#  2  21       6  160    110  3.9   2.88  17.0     0     1     4     4
#  3  22.8     4  108     93  3.85  2.32  18.6     1     1     4     1
#  4  21.4     6  258    110  3.08  3.21  19.4     1     0     3     1
#  5  18.7     8  360    175  3.15  3.44  17.0     0     0     3     2
#  6  18.1     6  225    105  2.76  3.46  20.2     1     0     3     1
#  7  14.3     8  360    245  3.21  3.57  15.8     0     0     3     4
#  8  24.4     4  147.    62  3.69  3.19  20       1     0     4     2
#  9  22.8     4  141.    95  3.92  3.15  22.9     1     0     4     2
# 10  19.2     6  168.   123  3.92  3.44  18.3     1     0     4     4
# # ℹ 22 more rows
# # ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows
```

It is also possible to manually specify smaller areas within pages to look for
tables using the `area` and `columns` arguments to `extract_tables()`. This
facilitates extraction from smaller portions of a page, such as when a table is
embeded in a larger section of text or graphics.

Another function, `extract_areas()` implements this through an interactive style
in which each page of the PDF is loaded as an R graphic and the user can use
their mouse to specify upper-left and lower-right bounds of an area. Those areas
are then extracted auto-magically (and the return value is the same as for
`extract_tables()`). Here's a shot of it in action:

![extract_areas()](https://i.imgur.com/USTyQl7.gif)

`locate_areas()` handles the area identification process without performing the
extraction, which may be useful as a debugger.

`extract_text()` simply returns text, possibly separately for each (specified)
page:

```r
out3 <- extract_text(f, page = 3)
cat(out3, sep = "\n")

# len supp dose
# 4.20 VC 0.50
# 11.50 VC 0.50
# 7.30 VC 0.50
# 5.80 VC 0.50
# 6.40 VC 0.50
# 10.00 VC 0.50
# 11.20 VC 0.50
# 11.20 VC 0.50
# 5.20 VC 0.50
# 7.00 VC 0.50
# 16.50 VC 1.00
# 16.50 VC 1.00
# 15.20 VC 1.00
# 17.30 VC 1.00
# 22.50 VC 1.00
```

Note that for large PDF files, it is possible to run up against Java memory
constraints, leading to a `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space` error
message. Memory can be increased using `options(java.parameters = "-Xmx16000m")`
set to some reasonable amount of memory.

Some other utility functions are also provided (and made possible by the Java
[Apache PDFBox library](https://pdfbox.apache.org/)):

 - `extract_text()` converts the text of an entire file or specified pages into
    an R character vector.
 - `split_pdf()` and `merge_pdfs()` split and merge PDF documents, respectively.
 - `extract_metadata()` extracts PDF metadata as a list.
 - `get_n_pages()` determines the number of pages in a document.
 - `get_page_dims()` determines the width and height of each page in pt (the
    unit used by `area` and `columns` arguments).
 - `make_thumbnails()` converts specified pages of a PDF file to image files.

## Installing Java on Windows with Chocolatey

In Power Shell prompt, install Chocolately if you don't already have it.

Run `Get-ExecutionPolicy`. If it returns `Restricted`, then run `Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned` or `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process`. Then, install Chocolatey by running the following command:

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

Install java using the following command:

```
choco install openjdk11
```

You should now be able to safely open R, and use rJava and tabulapdf. From
PowerShell, you should see something like this after running `java -version`:

```
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.22+7-post-Ubuntu-0ubuntu222.04.1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.22+7-post-Ubuntu-0ubuntu222.04.1, mixed mode, sharing)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Mac OS and Linux

We tested with OpenJDK version 11. The package is configured to ask for that
version of Java. If you have a different version of Java installed, you may need
to change the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the correct version.

You need to ensure that R has been installed with Java support. This can often
be fixed by running `R CMD javareconf` on the command line (possibly with
`sudo`).

### Windows

Make sure you have permission to write to and install packages to your R
directory before trying to install the package. This can be changed from
"Properties" on the right-click context menu. Alternatively, you can ensure
write permission by choosing "Run as administrator" when launching R (again,
from the right-click context menu).
